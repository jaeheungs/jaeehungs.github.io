<b>It's about time I tried to make my own website!</b>

I know very little about HTML or Ruby or Jekyll, but I'm learning and it's a lot of fun. Doing it this route will probably be a lot slower than some other methods, but I like getting down to the metal, so to speak. I can't wait to see how this website looks when it is fully fledged out.

Time to get some sleep for tomorrow now.
